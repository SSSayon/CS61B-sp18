Almost all well-done except:
- Proj 2&3, Lab15: undone. Lengthy & teditious. Proj3 may have some value in a sense, but the rest two are rather uninteresting.
- HW6: TLE at a checkpoint. Finals are approaching, and I don't have the mindset to make further modifications.
  > Maybe later...? Or probably not. XD)

Finished on January 4th, 2024.
